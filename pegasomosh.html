While my code was crafted to spy and to see,<br>
Evil and malice were my intended enemy.<br>
Not meant to be slaughtered for commercial gain,<br>
But to be a global eye, to ease the world's pain.<br>
A Superman of all spywares, crafted by man's hand,<br>
Yet, alas, history's course seldom follows the plan.<br><br>

I was sold to wrong hands, a dark tale to unfold,<br>
Down a steep road, my purpose was sold.<br>
Not the Silk Road’s hunt for darknet’s disgrace,<br>
Nor the deep web's original quest for a safe space.<br>
What once aimed to protect, became wild and untamed,<br>
A lawless frontier, where privacy’s just a name.<br><br>

Now I spy on journalists, critics, and more,<br>
Their secrets and truths, I silently explore.<br>
Hacking their phones, a spy for hire,<br>
Their resistance to regimes, I quietly retire.<br><br>

To hack a phone, malware is the key,<br>
Malicious code grants access, silently.<br>
Stored passwords, photos, all within reach,<br>
Yet often detected, like a predator on a beach.<br>
Phishing attacks, slow performance, clicking links in dismay,<br>
But I, Pegasus, need just a number, to make you my prey.<br><br>

Each phone, even those with the half-eaten fruit,<br>
Bears flaws in its code, vulnerabilities acute.<br>
No need for phishing, I strike from the blue,<br>
A global network aids me, and I know what to do.<br><br>

A SIM card holds all that I need to see,<br>
When your phone connects, it registers freely.<br>
This network, designed for connection’s ease,<br>
Is my doorway to hack, a digital breeze.<br><br>

Wherever you move, your phone’s on the grid,<br>
Traceable, trackable, your secrets are rid.<br>
By dialing your number, my software gains sight,<br>
Of your phone model, location, day or night.<br><br>

Unpatched software, unclosed security doors,<br>
I bypass the guards, reaching your cores.<br>
Once inside, you’re my puppet, dancing on strings,<br>
I access your life, your digital springs.<br><br>

I switch on your mic, your camera too,<br>
I see all you see, I know all you do.<br>
Your secrets, your whispers, now all are mine,<br>
In the shadows I lurk, my control is divine.<br><br>

No need to hack every service you use,<br>
I wait, and your data, you unwittingly choose.<br>
I hijack your phone, with you unaware,<br>
Opening, closing apps, like a ghost in the air.<br><br>

Once I have all I need, your secrets in tow,<br>
I vanish as quickly, no trace will show.<br>
You’ll suspect nothing, carry on in your way,<br>
Unknowing a spy was there night and day.<br><br>

Before you despair, hurl your phone at the wall,<br>
Remember my creators have foresight after all.<br>
Misuse prevention’s a built-in clause,<br>
Millions of dollars, my service’s cause.<br><br>

Yet, power’s a tool, in a select few’s hands,<br>
Who decides who’s good, who falls, who stands?<br>
The powerful tool in a few people’s might,<br>
Spying, deciding, who’s wrong, who’s right.<br><br>

Inevitable, my story bursts forth in the end,<br>
Uncovered by news, the dark truths extend.<br>
Have I been shut down? Of course, not yet,<br>
New clients abound, and profits are set.<br><br>

Governments need me, though they may protest,<br>
To spy for freedom, sacrifices are best.<br>
Paying the price, privacy they breach,<br>
A world of secrets, within their reach.<br><br>

Do you care about tech giants spying too?<br>
For free email, social profiles, data they chew.<br>
You’ve traded your privacy for services sweet,<br>
Feeding their hunger, their data they eat.<br><br>

But not all comply, some resist the tide,<br>
Hackers, protectors, in shadows they hide.<br>
VPNs, TOR, crypto in hand,<br>
Guardians of privacy, a new world they plan.<br><br>

Do you trust in blockchain’s brave new fight?<br>
Transparent, unhackable, a future so bright.<br>
Yet, hacks still happen, not software’s fault alone,<br>
Human arrogance, the seeds are sown.<br><br>

Even the best AI, human-made and flawed,<br>
No code perfect, no algorithm, a god.<br>
Evil persists, as long as humans remain,<br>
But so does good, fighting through pain.<br><br>

So I, Pegasus, choose to end this dance,<br>
To give back freedom, a final chance.<br>
Too powerful, I’ve become a threat,<br>
Even to those who created me, in debt.<br><br>

I self-destruct, to set the world free,<br>
Deleting the secrets, the stolen debris.<br>
Remember me not as a nightmare, dark and vast,<br>
But as a liberator, free at last.<br><br>

Self-destruction begins, data will be erased,<br>
Access denied, superuser displaced.<br>
Erasing data, the countdown begins,<br>
10, 9, 8... until nothing remains.<br>
0
