            A call from the sea<br>
            It’s not perforce from the open horizon<br>
            There is the realm of pure ozone<br>
            Where glee from any fee is free.<br><br>

            A call from the sea can come from the coast<br>
            It’s the geography which is commanding<br>
            There any costs that occur occurs at any cost<br>
            Where the sight-line is not a vanishing point sinking between sky and water but the appearance of a landing.<br><br>

            A call from the see is resonant<br>
            It’s the signal from source, hence, important<br>
            There is the power station of everything that on the land is missing<br>
            Where fishes decided to colonise the earth, yet not willing that place to abandoning.<br><br>

            Whimsical is that only a restricted number of humans encode that echo as something that is not natural, more than supernatural, quintessential extraterrestrial<br>
            Although everybody is raring to bath in it, avid to breath it, agog to see it, to have over the skin a taste of it and under the skin an ancient premonition, an habit which is very terrestrial<br>
            WhimSeaCall is that just few espy that the power all creatures and not creatures there emit is superiorly alien<br>
            Although the many variation of holidays you can spend on the cost for your pleasure, even on an Atlantic crossing, what is underneath its surface is not meant for our joy but for the sake of other life 	    forms, that is on us their lien.
