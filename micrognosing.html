“I know, but I have no proof”,<br>
Pier Paolo Pasolini looked aloof<br>
and that was his sentence,<br>
the epitaph of an existence<br>
that nobody take us for goof.<br><br>

“I don’t believe, I know”,<br>
Carl Gustav Jung’s frontal furrows show<br>
in depth his Psychology and Alchemy,<br>
it took him dreams for fighting his enemy,<br>
all the gnosis you can dream of and no shadow.<br><br>

(For such a kind of intuition<br>
one needs three and more than a name,<br>
a bigger-than-you game,<br>
a vast erudition, a sense for premonition, a strong opposition,<br>
what for a synchronicity<br>
that cultural voracity,<br>
apostasy and apostolicity).<br><br>

“I want to believe”,<br>
whistleblew of X-Files, a thieve,<br>
he infiltrated the Federal Buerau of Investigation,<br>
underwent several severe, more and more than a mere litigation,<br>
he wanted to unearth discoveries, disappearances, disclosures and make-believe.<br><br>

Agent W. was trained at Quantico till she was out<br>
like Fox Mulder, the paranormal psychologist, who was gaga about<br>
the sister lost on the vineyard and the Man Who Smokes,<br>
he had no many blokes,<br>
in a desert famous for fallout he had his own hideout.<br><br>

She was abducted by FBI from that New Age commune,<br>
deserted in a desert, to an alien virus immune,<br>
failed at becoming a doctor,<br>
became of agents an instructor,<br>
she’d abandoned Manhattan without a project, in search of Dion Fortune.<br><br>

“In UFO We Trust”,<br>
united by that lust<br>
because “there are more things in heaven<br>
and earth and Mars and our State is of cabalists a coven”,<br>
so X-files they dedust.<br><br>

Government’s method was always the same,<br>
discreditate, blame, discreditate, blame,<br>
every witness of a close encounters of the Third Eye<br>
would say to his reputation “good bye”,<br>
that was the frame, what a shame, such secrets would people inflame.<br><br>

So Fox and the foxy-lady agent<br>
came up with a special ingredient,<br>
a micro dosis of gnosis in a series<br>
to let arising unidentified queries,<br>
and at any event reality was no more that spent, in the air flying objects let a<br>
scent.
